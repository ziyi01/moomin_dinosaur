# Questions - Lab 3

## Assignment 1

- Test pressing BTN3 and BTN2 at the same time. What happens? Why?

They simultaneously update, the if statements registers if the buttons are pressed and stores this in a local variable and updates ``mytime`` together at the end.

- Three device-registers for input/output control are TRISE, TRISESET, and TRISECLR. Their functions are related. How? What are the differences?


- In the generated assembly code, in which MIPS register will the return values from functions getbtns and getsw be placed in. You should be able to answer this question without debugging the generated assembly code.


- In this exercise, we explained which bits that should be used in Port D and Port E. How can you find this information in the PIC32 and ChipKIT manuals? Be prepared to demonstrate how to find this information in the manuals. *Advice:* check the lecture slides from lecture 5 for ideas
